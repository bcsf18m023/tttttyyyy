first we have to drop partitions on the table added
before.
To do that, the following query is executed 
ALTER TABLE COMPANYEMPLOYEE DROP PARTITION p1;
ALTER TABLE COMPANYEMPLOYEE DROP PARTITION p2;
ALTER TABLE COMPANYEMPLOYEE DROP PARTITION p3;
ALTER TABLE COMPANYEMPLOYEE DROP PARTITION p4;
ALTER TABLE COMPANYEMPLOYEE DROP PARTITION p5;
ALTER TABLE COMPANYEMPLOYEE DROP PARTITION p6;
ALTER TABLE COMPANYEMPLOYEE DROP PARTITION p7;

Alter table COMPANYEMPLOYEE
Add partition by Range(Emp_Dept)
(
Partition p1 values In (1-20),
Partition p2 values In (21-40)
);
